# Note
This repository contains the API for the [Ionic application](https://github.com/maurei/Ionic-app). It also contains an AngularJS web application.

My contribution: 100% of the front-end logic (AngularJS, css styling not mine). About 30% of the backend (Disregarding the testsuits, those I did not contribute to). Also 100% of the Ionic app in the above link. (except for custom css).

Note: This code is two years old and written at a time when I had about a week of experience in AngularJS and Ionic. The project was completed in 4-5 days, and as such it serves mainly to demonstrate the learning curve with a new stack in a short period of time.

# Final project: Random Acts of Kindness
A simple CRUD application aimed at assisting those who wish to perform more random acts of kindness by assigning them kind and actionable tasks. Users can subscribe to a subset of kind tasks belonging to various categories, and can alter the completion state of assignments which moves them to a personal archive.

There currently is no live demo.
