# Random Acts of Kindness

A simple CRUD application aimed at assisting those who wish to perform more random acts of kindness by assigning them kind and actionable tasks. Users can subscribe to a subset of kind tasks belonging to various categories, and can alter the completion state of assignments which moves them to a personal archive.

This repository contains the API for the [Ionic application](https://github.com/maurei/Ionic-app). It also contains an AngularJS web application of which I have been responsible for.

There currently is no live demo. I plan to deploy the application to Heroku within a few days.
